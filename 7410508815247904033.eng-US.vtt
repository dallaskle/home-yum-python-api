You need to make this creamy Thai coconut chicken meatballs.

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:05.681
Perfect for midweek meal. They're prepable,

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:07.721
they're freezer friendly, and just an all round winner.

00:00:07.722 --> 00:00:09.401
I think you guys are gonna love this one.

00:00:09.402 --> 00:00:12.161
The meatballs contain grated courgette, chili, ginger,

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.521
garlic, coriander,

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.361
spring onion, light soy sauce,

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:18.361
lime and egg to bind. Simply roll into meatball shapes,

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:20.161
brown off and then make the sauce.

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:22.241
The same pan, add the Thai red curry paste,

00:00:22.242 --> 00:00:23.641
coconut milk, spring onion,

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:24.841
ginger, red pepper,

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:26.161
some chicken stock, soy sauce,

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.081
and finish with lime. Serve with warm,

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:29.121
fluffy rice

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:31.921
spoon over those chicken meatballs and creamy coconut sauce.

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:35.461
I like to add a side of broccoli for good luck. Just so good.
