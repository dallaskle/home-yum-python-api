AI Recipe & Meal Generator Backend – Developer Handoff
This document outlines the design, functionality, and implementation steps for building a FastAPI backend that generates both a recipe (ingredients, instructions, nutritional info) and a holistic image of the complete meal concurrently. The system is designed to:

Generate the recipe text and holistic image in parallel (to reduce wait times).
Allow user adjustments or confirmations.
Trigger additional, more detailed image generation (e.g., per-ingredient images) after confirmation, if needed.
Overview
Primary Output:

Recipe Text:
Ingredient list
Cooking instructions
Nutritional details
Holistic Image:
A single generated image representing the complete meal
Parallel Processing:

The backend must run the text generation and image generation concurrently.
After an initial combined output is returned, further detailed image generation can be triggered on confirmation.
User Flow:

The user submits a prompt (e.g., "chicken sandwich with lettuce") along with any optional parameters (like dietary preferences).
The API concurrently generates the recipe text and a holistic image.
A unified JSON response containing both outputs is returned to the user.
(Optional) If the user confirms the recipe, detailed images for each ingredient are generated in the background.
Technical Requirements
Dependencies & Project Setup
Core Dependencies:

FastAPI
Uvicorn
Asyncio (built-in)
HTTP clients for LLM and image generation APIs (e.g., OpenAI client)
(Optional) Libraries for background tasks such as Celery if scaling is required
Project Structure (example):

bash
Copy
/manual_recipe_          # FastAPI application & endpoints
  ├── manual_recipe_services/
  │     ├── recipe_generator.py   # Functions for recipe text generation
  │     └── image_generator.py    # Functions for holistic image generation
  ├── manual_recipe_utils/
  │     └── async_helpers.py      # Helper functions (e.g., run_in_threadpool wrappers)

Use environment variables or a config file for API keys and endpoints.
Ensure your requirements.txt is updated with all necessary libraries.
Generation Functions
Recipe Text Generation:
Implement an asynchronous function:

python
Copy
async def generate_recipe_text(prompt: str) -> dict:
    """
    Call the LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) with the provided prompt and return a dict
    with the generated recipe text (ingredients, instructions, nutrition).
    """
    # Example: Wrap a synchronous API call if needed:
    recipe = await run_in_threadpool(call_llm_api, prompt)
    return recipe
Holistic Image Generation:
Implement an asynchronous function:

python
Copy
async def generate_holistic_image(prompt: str) -> str:
    """
    Call the image generation API with the provided prompt and return the URL or
    file path to the generated holistic image.
    """
    image_url = await run_in_threadpool(call_image_api, prompt)
    return image_url
Parallel Execution:
Use asyncio.gather() to run both functions concurrently:

python
Copy
recipe_text, image_url = await asyncio.gather(
    generate_recipe_text(prompt),
    generate_holistic_image(prompt)
)
API Endpoint
POST /generate-recipe Endpoint:

Input: JSON payload with a field prompt (and optionally additional parameters such as dietary preferences).
Processing:
Receive the input.
Initiate both generation tasks concurrently.
Combine outputs into a unified JSON response.

(Optional) POST /confirm-recipe Endpoint:

Once the user confirms the initial recipe, trigger a background task (using asyncio.create_task() or FastAPI background tasks) that generates detailed images for each ingredient.
Update the recipe data with these detailed images.

This backend will generate both the recipe text and a holistic image concurrently, returning a unified response. This design minimizes upfront image generation costs by initially generating one comprehensive image, then (optionally) generating more detailed images after user confirmation. Make sure to follow asynchronous best practices and optimize for resource usage to ensure the API remains responsive under load.
